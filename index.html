          I'm a software engineer at 100Devs. Here, I primarily design &amp;
          build interactive websites with responsive features and web
          applications using current frameworks and packages, delivering timely
          solutions while maintaining customer satisfaction.

        <!-- <span>About Me</span> -->
        <h3>Why you need a website?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong> Mobile users account for<strong
            >&nbsp;more than half (~53%) of all web traffic!</strong
          >
          If your website is not optimized for smartphones, you're missing out
          on the majority of clients!
        </p>
        <p>
          The&nbsp;*bounce rate*&nbsp;for an average website can be&nbsp;[as
          high as&nbsp;**50-75%**]. This means that for every 4 people who
          visit, 2 or 3 will&nbsp;*immediately exit*&nbsp;without engaging with
          your content. But it doesn't have to be this way! This is where I come
          in: my job is to captivate your audience with a sleek, user-friendly
          website that showcases the best your business has to offer. When it
          comes to growing your business online, you don't have time for a
          lengthy courtship -- we're aiming for love at first sight.

        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
        <p>
          The best way to see your website project come to life is through
          wireframes and mockups during the early stages of development. I
          design these vibrant &amp; colorful sketches as inital presentations
          and keep clients engaged with the experience.

        <h3>Improved SEO</h3>
        <p>
          Responsive web design is becoming as important to search engine
          optimization as quality content. Stronger backlinks and better bounce
          rates translate into higher search rankings, but there is an extra SEO
          benefit for mobile optimized sites. Having a single responsive website
          rather than separate desktop and mobile versions avoids the issue of
          duplicate content, which can negatively impact your search ranking.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          I provide website development services that are on the cutting edge of
          todayâ€™s technologies. I am versed in all Web technologies such as
          WordPress, Shopify. I even custom develop websites and web
          applications.

        <h3>Creative Design</h3>
        <p>
          You need more than just a website, you need meaningful outcomes from
          your business. You therefore need more than just a web designer, you
          need a partner to deliver those outcomes!

        <h3>Fully Responsive</h3>
        <p>
          It's increasingly important for businesses to have websites that
          render properly on smaller screens so that users don't encounter
          distorted images or experience a sub-optimal site layout, responsive
          design is becoming the norm because it offers greater versatility at
          lower development costs

        ></span>
        <h3>Mobile Ready</h3>
        <p>
          A large majority of your web traffic is viewing your site from a
          mobile device - at least 45 percent. You have complex site content or
          features that are difficult to use on a mobile device. I plan on your
          website to having a longer shelf life and want it to appear up-to-date
          for longer.
